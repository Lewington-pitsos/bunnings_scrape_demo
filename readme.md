# Bunnings Scrape

This repo goes with this video:

`scrape.rb` is the file I make during the video. `complete_scrape.rb` is like, a more good version of that file. The idea is that you could like, scrape the average cost for whatever product list you wanted from (Bunnings Warehouse)[https://www.bunnings.com.au/] just by altering the `root` variable.

I only ask that you try not to go *too* mad with power.
